# 🍽️ LeftoverLink

**Connecting food to those in need**

LeftoverLink is a web application that helps reduce food waste by connecting restaurants, bakeries, and food businesses with leftover food to individuals, charities, and organizations who can benefit from it. Instead of throwing away perfectly good leftover food, businesses can post their available items on LeftoverLink, and people in need can find and claim them.
